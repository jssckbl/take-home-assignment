This is a React app for formatting text. It has two modes: one that changes every letter to uppercase and one that changes every letter to lowercase. Two buttons, labeled "UPPERCASE" and "lowercase" allow the user to toggle between the two modes.

For example, if we had the following as input:

```
This is some text.
```

Submitting the form in the uppercase mode should output the following:

```
THIS IS SOME TEXT.
```

And submitting the form in the lowercase mode should output the following:

```
this is some text.
```

## How To Test

1. `npm install`
2. `npm start`
3. Navigate to `localhost:3000`
4. Input text to test
5. Click "submit"
6. Click "UPPERCASE" or "lowercase" to see the submitted text change
